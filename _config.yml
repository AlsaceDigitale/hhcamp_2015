      answer: "Add your challenge on the <a href='http://hhcamp.sparkboard.com'>sparkboard</a>."
    - question: "Until when could I submit a challenge ?"
      answer: "Until event start, march 22nd midnight."
    - question: "How to build a team ?"
      answer: "A good team is composed at least of 1 health professional, 1 developer, 1 designer. 6 people by team is a good number but there is no rules on that. You can start recruit before the event by using the sparkboard or come to our Hacking Health Coffee. Team will be official on friday night after pitches."
    - question: "What is the goal of this event ?"
      answer: "Our hypothesis is that the collaboration between front-line clinicians and technology experts will yield innovative approaches to some of healthcare’s most entrenched problems. By rapidly building and testing prototypes, on one end we identify the ideas that have the true potential to scale and on the other we allow participants to take the knowledge they acquired and apply it to new ideas. Our goal is to make this experimentation as low risk as possible for everyone involved - the individual participants, organizers, and supporters."
    - question: "What about intellectual property - who will own my idea ?"
      answer: "As a facilitator, Hacking Health does not make any claims to IP that emerges from the event. It up to each team to decide ownership of any work that is done during the hackathon. Teams generally share IP based on individual contributions and commitment, but project leads should establish that with their team in advance. A hackathon is an ideal place to work on ideas which you are comfortable sharing with others, but this does not mean that you must give up ownership of your idea or project. Some hackathon projects lead to the founding of a real company down the road, while others are released for free to the community. It is up to each project lead to decide on a structure, and communicate this to collaborators. The risks of exposing an idea are often outweighed by the benefits of the feedback and collaboration you will receive if people get excited about your vision. If you have concerns about the IP in your project, we recommend consulting a lawyer."
    - question: "Is there a cost ?"
      answer: "We ask a fee from each participant to help us cover hard costs, like food and space rental. Discounts are always available for students and startups."
    - question: "Can I get a refund once I've purchased a ticket ?"
      answer: "Yes, but the deadline for refunds is a week prior to the start of the event. With only a week left until the event starts, we can only exchange your ticket if you're able to find another participant."
    - question: "Where can we sleep ?"
      answer: "Find all information on <a href='venue.html'>venue</a> page."
    - question: "Who organize ?"
      answer: "<a href='http://www.hackinghealth.ca' target='_blank'>Hacking Health</a> and <a href='http://www.alsacedigitale.org' target='_blank'>Alsace Digitale</a>"
    - question: "How many attendees will be there ?"
      answer: "500 during full event, 300 on Future of Health, 300 on Health Data Day and Hackathon"
    - question: "Don't find your answer ?"
      answer: "<a href='mailto:s.letelie@hackinghealth.ca' target='_blank'>Contact us</a>"
