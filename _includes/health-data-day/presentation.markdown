## A full day of workshops and conferences centered around the technical, medical, privacy and legal aspects of producing, consuming and analyse health data.

The event strives to reflect both on the technological aspects and the important questions driving the health sectorâ€™s future:

 -  What changes will big data and data analysis bring to healthcare ?
 -  What changes can we expect for patient and healthcare services ?
 -  Where to find health data and how to use it to improve healthcare?
 -  All this accumulated data has a value, how and where we can find this value to improve healthcare ?
 -  Cloud based storage: how to balance access and privacy ?
 -  What about legal aspects, how does each country secure its health data ?

We want to provide health tech companies with the opportunity to present their products and explain how developers and users can benefit from them. We want to help the health industry understand the value of adopting an open data policy, as we believe the health sector needs a paradigm shift if it wants to develop more sustainable and actionable solutions.
