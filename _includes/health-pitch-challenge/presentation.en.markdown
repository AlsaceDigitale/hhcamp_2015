## A festive event dedicated to health startups, complete with the presence of investors.

An evening party dedicated to health startups already created with investors present.

Let’s not forget that one of our key goal is to create concrete solutions that improve healthcare. The only way to follow through with our intention is by creating startups. We have to support startups and help them grow. This event provides to selected startups the opportunity to pitch their idea to VIP guests, invited investors and participants.

Just like crowdfunding, each member of the audience will be given 3 fake banknotes of 500€, 200€ and 100€ and will be asked to put their money on their favorite startups. The results will be presented at the end of the event to see which startup raised more funds.

####Besides providing a fun way to promote startups, the Health Pitch Challenge is great place for creating meaningful connections and engaging in great conversations.
