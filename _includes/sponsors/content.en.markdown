Jean-Luc Dimarcq - IHU

> It was fun, interesting and professional to participate as member of the Jury at the first French Hackathon in Strasbourg. I was inspired by the imagination of all the teams and for Leader Health my company it was a great value to understand new needs of the French health system.

Thierry Courbis - Leader Health

> Un moment d'exception au sens propre du terme, beaucoup d'échanges, de créativité et des résultats étonnamment aboutis à la fin du Hackathon
