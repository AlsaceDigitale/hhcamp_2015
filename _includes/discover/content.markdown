#Event Program

##The event was designed according to the following principles: inspire, learn, act

###[The Future of Health](future-of-health.html)

#####9:30 - 17:00,  Thursday, March 19, 2015

A entire day of inspiring and forward-thinking conferences on the future of health by a line up of internationally-recognized health mentors.

###[Health Pitch Challenge](health-pitch-challenge.html) : health startups kontest party

#####19:00 - 22:00, Thursday evening, March 19, 2015

A festive event dedicated to health startups, complete with the presence of investors. Early-stage startups will pitch; attendees will vote by investing in their favorite startups with fake banknotes. The winner will be the one who raises the most money.

###[Health Data Day](health-data-day.html) : big Data in Healthcare is here, how can we use it ?

#####9:00 - 17:00, Friday March 20, 2015

A full day of workshops and conferences centered around the technical, medical, privacy and legal aspects of producing, consuming and analyse health data.

###[Health Hackathon](health-hackathon.html) : prototyping Weekend

#####17:00, Friday 20 to 22:00, Sunday 22 March, 2015

The second annual hackathon will run from Friday evening to Sunday evening. Health professionals, developers and designers will create prototypes based on challenges submitted before the event.

The idea is simple :  as inspiration is the essence of creation, what’s best than listening to well known and visionary physicians, entrepreneurs and philosophers to be inspired and seeing startups already innovating. Then exchanging about health data and learning about medical and technical opportunities. Finally transform all this in action by working together to create innovation and next big thing.

During the first edition, health professionals and designers, developers, UX researchers and engineers expressed their expectations about topics such as : ethic, health datas, interoperability, what is the worldwide evolution of digital in healthcare ? Where are the technical limits ? What are legal issues and solutions ? What data exist, how to access it and use it to improve healthcare and deliver on the Big Data promise ?

###With Hacking Health Camp you will find answers to these questions.

#A High Profile Event

Hacking Health Camp is a place of innovation in action and we are on the fast track to become Europe’s biggest and most important event in healthcare innovation.

###Past events and outcomes
Hacking Health is an international movement: since 2012, over 12 hackathons and dozens of healthcare events took place in Canada and across the world. “**[Hacking Health @ DigitalHealthCamp](http://digitalhealthcamp.eu)**”, the first French edition of the Health hackathon took place in march 2014 in Strasbourg  and more hackathons are scheduled to take place in Hong Kong, Saskatoon, New York and Berlin to name a few.

About the creative energy of **[Hacking Health @ DigitalHealthCamp](http://digitalhealthcamp.eu)** :

> “We all regret we were not in Steve Jobs’ garage in the 80’s, but in 30 years, you will be able to say that you were here in Strasbourg, today…”

Uwe Diegel, iHealth founder, march 30th 2014

####The Hackathon Concept

50 hours event in which the “users” (health professionals) and the "makers" (designers, developers, UX researchers and engineers) collaborate around challenges submitted before the event. The last day, they present a functional prototype to the jury and the assembly.

The first edition of **[Hacking Health @ DigitalHealthCamp](http://digitalhealthcamp.eu)** was a huge success thanks to its ability to cater directly to the needs expressed by healthcare professional:

 - participation : 200 attendees came from all over France. Among them :  45 health professionals  (nurses, pharmacists, psychiatrists, physiotherapist,...) and about 100 hackers.
 - for 35 challenges submitted there were 19 quality prototypes created, ex: Flashmed, MedMatch, ContAAct, Lifealth, with some of them now having graduated to fully functioning start ups.
   - “It works, it’s incredible…” about MedMatch, Uwe Diegel, iHealth founder
   - 10 of them received awards
   - **[take a look at all projects](http://projects.digitalhealthcamp.eu/)**
   - **[watch a video presentation of last year’s event](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EFhyYTip72E&list=PLKHIK5minrP6NXwHfUF3lD5SbmlbclGhK)**
 - This was the first hackathon in France  to garner interest from national media, both generalist and specialized: Le Figaro, M6,  iTélé, Le quotidien du médecin, DNA, Rue89 Strasbourg,... (**[see our press and media clippings](http://digitalhealthacamp.eu/#presse)**)

Participants had the opportunity to co-create in an exceptional environment filled with worldwide experts who believed in the importance of this hackathon, and came to share their skills with its participants  :

 - health expert lawyers : Caroline Zorn, Pierre Desmarais,....
 - successful health businessmen  : Uwe Diegel, Luc Sirois, Thierry Courbis,...
 - experienced health designers : Barbara Bay, Christelle Carrier,...
 - group mentors to optimize group cohesion and work : Pascal Bastien, Véronique Campillo, Guillame Lours ...
 - preto typing expert : Elalami Lafkih

####Hacking Health camp allows you to:

 - push your collaborative boundaries and problem-solving skills
 - create a prototype based on consumer requirements and feedback
 - improve your prototype and understanding of the health sector through the advice of industry leaders


#Why ?

Hacking Health is an experiment in collaboration. Our hypothesis is that the collaboration between front-line clinicians and technology experts will yield innovative approaches to some of healthcare’s most entrenched problems. By rapidly building and testing prototypes, on one end we identify the ideas that have the true potential to scale and on the other we allow participants to take the knowledge they acquired and apply it to new ideas. Our goal is to make this experimentation as low risk as possible for everyone involved - the individual participants, organizers, and supporters.

At Hacking Health, we aim to create spaces for collaborative, interdisciplinary experimentation. We bring together health professionals and technologists to work together to prototype and problem-solve new ways to deliver healthcare. It’s a high-energy, messy process with no guarantee of success, but plenty of opportunity for new ideas and to join a team. The outcomes are probabilistic not determinate.

We define success as making it easier to reach the limit of one’s field and increasing the probability of successfully interfacing with another perspective so it yields an innovative approach. Our underlying mission is learning how to bring pioneers from across diverse fields together through real and meaningful collaborations.

####WE BELIEVE THAT
Real change comes from the bottom up.

Innovation occurs at the interface of diverse minds and perspectives.

Collaboration is hard. It requires stepping beyond one’s comfort zone, into the unfamiliar.

But it’s worth it.

##This year’s theme: Big Data and its Impact on the Health Sector

It is now essential: existing and future health products must open their data to integrate the global health information system. By sharing this data, the health sector acknowledges the wide array of required skills, diversity of needs and the particularities to consider in response to these needs.

Yet an open data approach requires precautions when it comes to privacy and security: how to protect personal data while using it to improve patient care? How to share data anonymously, yet effectively? What are the best communications tools and infrastructure to achieve this?

During the first edition, health professionals and designers, developers, UX researchers and engineers expressed their expectations about topics such as : ethics, health data, interoperability. We decided to use the most interesting topics raised by last year’s event to shape this year’s program:

What is the worldwide evolution of digital in healthcare ? Where are the technical limits ? What are the legal issues and solutions ? What data exist, how to access it and use it to improve healthcare and deliver on the Big Data promise ?
