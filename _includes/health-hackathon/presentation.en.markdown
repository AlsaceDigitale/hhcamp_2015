## The second annual hackathon will run from Friday evening to Sunday evening. Health professionals, developers and designers will create prototypes based on challenges submitted before the event.

We use a “hacker” inspired approach that combines front-line user experience with talent from diverse fields to generate innovative concepts that can be rapidly prototyped and refined. While the term “hacker” has had inappropriately negative connotation, “hacking” simply means to challenge seemingly entrenched problems by testing innovative concepts and ideas through the rapid building and testing of low-cost prototypes.

While the term “hacking” has its origins in software development, this approach is now being applied to tackle a range of social issues from education to climate change or governance. The hacker approach is most intensely applied by non-profits, businesses, and governments where they are confronted with issues challenged by imbalances in power, inflexible systems, and an underlying culture of groups and organizations that resist disruption.

Technology alone cannot necessarily deliver change. However, well-designed, user-informed digital tools can influence individual behaviour and disrupt traditional cultural norms by making information more accessible, systems more transparent, and ultimately by giving a voice to more people.
